Memclaw is a lightweight, local-first personal memory assistant. It stores your thoughts, notes, images, and links as **plain Markdown files** and makes them instantly searchable through **hybrid vector + keyword search**.

Think of it as your second brain — one that actually remembers.

</p>

## Why Memclaw?

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is great — but it connects to dozens of tools, reads your filesystem, runs shell commands, and does a hundred things you didn't ask for. That makes it slow, expensive, and a security surface you have to think about every time you use it.

Memclaw takes one slice of what OpenClaw does — **memory** — and does it really well, without the rest.

**Total recall.** Save a thought today, retrieve it six months later with a vague description. *"What was that restaurant Alex told me about?"* — Memclaw finds it. Hybrid vector + keyword search means you don't need to remember exact words.

**Visual memory.** Send an image and Memclaw generates an AI caption, indexes it, and stores it. Later, just ask *"that food recipe photo"* or *"the whiteboard from last sprint"* and it comes right back.

**Link memory.** Drop a link and Memclaw fetches the page, summarizes it, and indexes the content. Months later, ask *"that article about distributed databases"* and it surfaces the link with context — no bookmarking app needed.

**Reminders, too.** Ask *"remind me tomorrow at 9am to call Alex"* and the bot pings you back in the same chat. One-shot or recurring.

**Sandboxed by design.** Memclaw only touches `~/.memclaw/`. No filesystem access, no shell commands, no path traversal. You don't need to trust it with your whole computer — it can't see it.

**Lightweight and cheap.** No Docker. No Postgres. No sprawling tool graph burning tokens. Just Python, SQLite, and two API tokens. Fast responses, minimal cost.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install memclaw
memclaw
```

On first run, the setup wizard asks how you want to talk to Memclaw — **Telegram**, **WhatsApp**, **Slack**, or **Terminal** — and only prompts for the API tokens relevant to that choice. Saved to `~/.memclaw/.env`. From then on, running `memclaw` launches whichever front-end you picked. Run `memclaw configure` anytime to change platform or update keys.

To upgrade to the latest release later:

```bash
pip install --upgrade memclaw   # or `pipx upgrade memclaw`
```

Your config and memories live in `~/.memclaw/` and are preserved across upgrades.

> **Deploying to a server?** See [Running on a VPS with Docker](docs/docker.md) for a Docker Compose setup.

## Messaging Platforms

The main way to use Memclaw. Just talk to it naturally — no commands needed. Send text, photos, voice messages, or links, or ask to be reminded later. The agent figures out what to do: store it, search your memories, retrieve images, schedule a reminder, or just chat.

All platforms share the same agent, memories, and search index — your data is unified regardless of how you interact.

### Telegram Bot

The Telegram bot shows a **typing indicator** while processing so you know it's working on your request.

#### Setup

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Get your Telegram user ID (e.g. via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)).
3. Run `memclaw` and pick **Telegram** in the wizard. On first run you'll be prompted for the Telegram token and allowed user IDs:

```bash
memclaw
```

### WhatsApp Bot

Uses your **personal WhatsApp account** via WhatsApp Web pairing — no Meta Business account, no webhooks, no public server. Powered by [`neonize`](https://github.com/krypton-byte/neonize) (whatsmeow under the hood).

#### Prerequisite: libmagic

neonize depends on `python-magic`, which needs the `libmagic` system library:

- macOS: `brew install libmagic`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libmagic1`
- Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install file-libs`

#### Setup

Run `memclaw` and pick **WhatsApp** in the wizard:

```bash
memclaw
```

On first run a QR code is printed to your terminal. On your phone: **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device**, and scan it. The session persists under `~/.memclaw/whatsapp/` so you only pair once.

Only messages you send to yourself (via WhatsApp's "Message Yourself" chat) are processed. DMs from other people and group messages are ignored.

> **Reminders caveat:** because the bot runs as you and replies in your own "Message Yourself" chat, WhatsApp doesn't push a notification when a reminder fires — the message just appears silently in the chat. Support for delivering reminders from a dedicated Memclaw phone number (so you do get a notification) is coming soon.

### Slack Bot

The Slack bot connects via **Socket Mode** (WebSocket) — no public URL or webhook server needed.

#### Setup (from manifest — recommended)

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → **From a manifest**, pick your workspace, and paste:

    ```yaml
    display_information:
      name: Memclaw
      description: Your personal memory vault, powered by AI.
      background_color: "#1a1a1a"
    features:
      bot_user:
        display_name: Memclaw
        always_online: true
      app_home:
        home_tab_enabled: false
        messages_tab_enabled: true
        messages_tab_read_only_enabled: false
    oauth_config:
      scopes:
        bot:
          - app_mentions:read
          - channels:history
          - chat:write
          - files:read
          - files:write
          - im:history
          - im:read
          - im:write
    settings:
      event_subscriptions:
        bot_events:
          - app_mention
          - message.im
      interactivity:
        is_enabled: false
      socket_mode_enabled: true
    ```

2. **Install to Workspace** and copy the **Bot Token** (`xoxb-...`).
3. Under **Basic Information → App-Level Tokens**, generate a token with `connections:write` scope and copy it (`xapp-...`).
4. Run `memclaw` and pick **Slack** in the wizard:

```bash
memclaw
```

You can DM the bot directly or mention it in channels (`@Memclaw save this...`). Optionally restrict it to specific channels with `SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS`, or to specific users with `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` (find your Slack ID via **Profile → ••• → Copy member ID**).

To update keys later: `memclaw configure`.

### What it handles

| Message type | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Text** | Agent decides: store as memory, search existing memories, or both. |
| **Link** | URLs in any message are fetched, summarized, and indexed alongside the surrounding text for later retrieval. |
| **Photo** | AI-described via vision model, stored and indexed. Agent acknowledges and responds. Saved for later retrieval. |
| **Voice / Audio** | Transcribed via Whisper, stored as text. Agent responds to the content. Links extracted. |
| **Reminders** | One-shot (`remind me tomorrow at 9am to call Alex`) or recurring (`remind me every 5 hours to drink water`). Delivered back to the same chat. List with *show my reminders*, cancel by id. |

### Examples

```
> Just had coffee with Alex. She's moving to Berlin for a role at Stripe.
Got it! I've saved that Alex is moving to Berlin for a new role at Stripe.

> Who is Alex?
Based on your memories, Alex is someone you had coffee with recently.
She's moving to Berlin for a new role at Stripe.

> Show me the whiteboard photo from last week
[sends the matching photo]
Here's the sprint planning whiteboard you saved last week.

> Remind me tomorrow at 9am to call Alex
Reminder #4 scheduled for 2025-06-16T09:00.
```

## Agent Backend

Memclaw runs your messages through a pluggable agent SDK. Two backends are supported, and the setup wizard asks which one to use — only that backend's keys are saved to `~/.memclaw/.env`. Switch later anytime with `memclaw configure`.

- **Claude** (default) — via the [`claude-agent-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/claude-agent-sdk/). Works with a Claude subscription (Pro/Max/Team) or an Anthropic API key.
- **Cursor** — via the [`cursor-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/cursor-sdk/). Uses Composer 2.5 by default. Requires a Cursor API key. Install with `pip install 'memclaw[cursor]'` to pull in the SDK.

### Claude

The wizard asks you to pick one of two auth modes:

- **Claude subscription** (Pro / Max / Team) — generate a long-lived token with `claude setup-token`; Memclaw saves it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Requests bill against your plan, and the per-message cost line is omitted from logs.
- **Anthropic API key** (pay-as-you-go) — set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to an `sk-ant-…` key. Requests bill per token against your console credits, and the cost is logged with each turn.

Only one of the two is set at a time.

### Cursor

- Generate an API key from the Cursor Dashboard → Integrations (or a team service account key).
- The wizard prompts for `CURSOR_API_KEY` and an optional `CURSOR_MODEL` (defaults to `composer-2.5`).
- Memclaw tools are exposed to the Cursor agent via a long-lived local HTTP MCP server on `127.0.0.1` (default port `17373`, override with `MEMCLAW_MCP_PORT`).
- Requests bill per token against your Cursor plan (or pay-as-you-go overage rates once your plan limit is reached), and the cost is logged with each turn.

Memclaw draws inspiration from [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s memory architecture and drives a pluggable agent SDK ([Claude](https://pypi.org/project/claude-agent-sdk/) or [Cursor](https://pypi.org/project/cursor-sdk/)) that handles the agentic loop, prompt caching, and tool wiring — see [Agent Backend](#agent-backend) for setup.

### Storage Layer

All memories are plain Markdown — human-readable, editable, and git-friendly.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.memclaw/MEMORY.md` | Curated long-term facts and preferences |
| `~/.memclaw/AGENTS.md` | Customizable agent instructions and user preferences |
| `~/.memclaw/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Timestamped daily entries |
| `~/.memclaw/memclaw.db` | SQLite index (vector embeddings + FTS5) |

### Search Layer

Every memory is chunked, embedded, and indexed in SQLite. Retrieval combines two signals:

- **Vector search** (70% weight) — cosine similarity via OpenAI embeddings finds semantically related memories even when wording differs
- **Keyword search** (30% weight) — BM25 via SQLite FTS5 catches exact tokens, names, and identifiers
- **Temporal decay** — recent memories score higher (30-day half-life), MEMORY.md entries are evergreen
- **MMR deduplication** — removes near-duplicate results to keep search diverse

### Agent Layer

A pluggable agent SDK drives the loop — Claude or Cursor, picked during setup ([Agent Backend](#agent-backend)). The agent keeps a rolling conversation history that always covers at least the last 10 message pairs, plus any older messages from the last hour — whichever set is larger — so short bursts of chatter stay in context without dropping continuity during slower conversations. It decides when to **store** vs **search** based on your intent.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_save` | Writes a new entry to today's daily file or MEMORY.md |
| `memory_search` | Hybrid search across all indexed memories |
| `image_save` | Generates an AI description of an image and stores it |
| `image_search` | Retrieves previously stored images by description |
| `file_write` / `file_read` | Sandboxed file operations within `~/.memclaw/` |
| `update_instructions` | Appends user preferences to AGENTS.md |
| `reminder_create` / `reminder_list` / `reminder_cancel` | Schedules one-shot or recurring reminders, delivered back to the originating chat |

## Usage

### Interactive Mode (default)

```bash
memclaw
```

Chat naturally:

```
> Just had coffee with Alex. She's moving to Berlin next month for a new role at Stripe.
✓ Memory saved

> Who is Alex?
Based on your memories, Alex is someone you had coffee with recently.
She's moving to Berlin for a new role at Stripe.

> /quit
```

### Direct Commands

These work without the agent — only the OpenAI key is needed for embeddings.

```bash
# Save a quick note
memclaw save "Meeting at 3pm with the design team about the rebrand"

# Search your memories
memclaw search "design team meetings"

# Consolidate daily files into MEMORY.md
memclaw consolidate

# Rebuild the search index
memclaw index

# Check your memory vault
memclaw status

# Verify your OpenAI key has access to every model Memclaw uses
memclaw doctor
```

If voice messages aren't being transcribed or link summaries come back empty, run `memclaw doctor`. It probes the three OpenAI models Memclaw depends on — `text-embedding-3-small` (search), `gpt-5-mini` (link summaries), and `whisper-1` (voice) — and tells you which ones your project has access to. The same check runs automatically at the end of the setup wizard.

### Saving Images

In interactive mode, tell the agent to save an image:

```
> Save the image at ~/photos/whiteboard.jpg — it's our sprint planning board
✓ Image saved: A whiteboard showing a sprint planning layout with colorful sticky notes...
```

The image is described by an AI vision model and the description is stored and indexed like any other memory.

## Configuration

On first run, `memclaw` launches an interactive setup wizard that asks which front-end platform you want to use (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, or Terminal), then prompts only for keys relevant to that choice and saves them to `~/.memclaw/.env`. Run `memclaw configure` anytime to switch platform or update keys — it will again only ask for keys matching the platform you pick.

You can also set keys via environment variables or a `.env` in the current directory — these take the usual precedence over the saved config.

```bash
memclaw --memory-dir ~/my-vault   # override storage location
```

Backend choice and credentials are covered above in [Agent Backend](#agent-backend).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Embeddings + image descriptions + voice transcription |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | One of these two | Claude subscription token from `claude setup-token` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | One of these two | Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-…`), pay-as-you-go |
| `AGENT_BACKEND` | Optional | Agent SDK to use (defaults to `claude`; set to `cursor` for Cursor SDK) |
| `MEMCLAW_PLATFORM` | Optional | Front-end the bare `memclaw` launches: `telegram`, `whatsapp`, `slack`, or `terminal` (defaults to `terminal`) |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | For Cursor backend | Cursor API key from Dashboard → Integrations |
| `CURSOR_MODEL` | For Cursor backend | Cursor model name (defaults to `composer-2.5`) |
| `MEMCLAW_MCP_PORT` | For Cursor backend | Local MCP HTTP port (defaults to `17373`) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | For Telegram bot | Your Telegram bot token |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | For Telegram bot | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | For Slack bot | Slack bot token (`xoxb-...`) |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` | For Slack bot | Slack app-level token for Socket Mode (`xapp-...`) |
| `SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` | For Slack bot | Comma-separated Slack channel IDs (optional) |
| `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` | For Slack bot | Comma-separated Slack user IDs (optional — restricts who can DM/mention the bot) |

## Architecture

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)'s approach to AI memory:

- **Markdown as source of truth** — all memories live as plain text you can read, edit, and version-control
- **SQLite for indexing** — zero-config database with FTS5 for keyword search and BLOBs for embeddings
- **NumPy for vectors** — cosine similarity computed in-memory, no native extensions required
- **Pluggable agent SDK** — Claude or Cursor drives the agentic loop that decides how to handle your input ([Agent Backend](#agent-backend))
- **Chunking with overlap** — ~300-word chunks with 60-word overlap preserve context across boundaries
- **Auto-consolidation** — daily files are periodically distilled into MEMORY.md
- **Filesystem guardrail** — every `file_read` / `file_write` tool call is path-checked, blocking anything outside `~/.memclaw/`
- **Embedding cache** — SHA-256 content hashing skips redundant API calls

For a deep dive into how memory storage, search, consolidation, and context injection work, see the [Memory Architecture](docs/memory-architecture.md) doc.

## Using as a Library

```python
import asyncio
from memclaw.config import MemclawConfig
from memclaw.store import MemoryStore
from memclaw.index import MemoryIndex
from memclaw.search import HybridSearch

async def main():
    config = MemclawConfig()
    store = MemoryStore(config)
    index = MemoryIndex(config)
    search = HybridSearch(config, index)

    # Save a memory
    path = store.save("The best pizza in town is at Mario's on 5th Ave")
    await index.index_file(path)

    # Search
    results = await search.search("pizza recommendations")
    for r in results:
        print(f"{r.score:.2f}: {r.content[:80]}")

    index.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```
